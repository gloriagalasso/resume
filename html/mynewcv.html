        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>
            Experienced full stack developer and CEO of a web development company, with nine years of extensive
            experience in building and maintaining digital solutions. Since founding my company in 2023, I have been
            delivering comprehensive web services, including front-end and back-end development, as well as server
            management across shared hosting, VPS, and cloud platforms. I also utilize GitLab and Git to efficiently build
            and deploy applications across multiple environments, including acceptance, beta, and production, ensuring
            seamless transitions and robust performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since August 2020, I have collaborated closely with Isabel Group, Belgium’s leading fintech company,
            initially as an employee and later as an external consultant. I have developed, refined, and managed 19 web
            applications utilizing PHP (Vanilla, WordPress, Laravel), JavaScript (Node.js, Webpack, Vue, React), HTML,
            SCSS/CSS, MySQL and NoSQL database and Python for automation and data analysis. These applications
            are fully integrated with CRMs like HubSpot and Microsoft Dynamics, various third-party REST and SOAP
            APIs, and Excel-based calculators to efficiently generate contracts or documents in PDF format—achieving
            optimized user experiences through robust PHP and JavaScript frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my work, I ensure efficient project tracking and workflow management using tools such as Slack,
            Jira, Google Sheets, and Monday.com (and their APIs). With proficiency in CMS platforms like WordPress,
            Drupal, and ExpressionEngine, I’ve recently been expanding my knowledge in using low-code platforms like
            DatoCMS and Strapi.js paired with static site generators like Nuxt, bringing a blend of technical expertise and
            strategic insight to every project.
